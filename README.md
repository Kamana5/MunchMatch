Web app that allows a group of people to decide on a restaurant or an activity to do together.  A host will create a session and members of the group will join with a unique code. The web app will pull data of near by restaurants or activities using google maps API and maybe store it in a lightweight database. Each member of the group will get the restaurant/activity option on their device and can choose to skip or choose that option. The place will be decided when all members have all chosen for the same restaurant. 

Additions: Have an option for the web app to randomly choose a place.
